 <h1>The Best Movies According to Thennal</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 Movies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Aadujeevitham</h3>
 <p>From the shores of Kerala, India, The Goat Life (or Aadujeevitham in Malayalam) is a breathtaking survival story (that transcends language and geography) about an Indian man who is forced to work as a goat herder in a Saudi desert against his will. Actor Prithviraj Sukumaran underwent an arduous transformation for this role, and his performance is amplified by stunning visuals and a haunting score. Director Blessy's tale is an exploration of hope and resilience that lingers long after the credits roll. I would highly recommend Aadujeevitham to witness Prithviraj's skilful acting and how immersive the world is.</p>

 <h3>Thudarum</h3>
 <p>"Thudarum" emerges as a refreshing and compelling cinematic experience, deserving of its 5-star rating for its exceptional execution across all departments. Anchored by the stellar presence of Mohanlal, the film transcends mere fan service, establishing itself as a meticulously crafted piece of cinema. This is a movie that prioritizes storytelling and artistic merit, offering a complete and deeply satisfying viewing experience.</p>

 <h3>Lokah</h3>
 <p>Malayalam cinema has never shied away from experimenting with any genre, but Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra takes the cake when it comes to the superhero space, and that too, for a supposedly cinematic universe movie. To say Lokah nailed it with its debut would be a massive understatement. It's not just about the theme, the lore, or the story. The way the screenplay was crafted is on par with some of the best Marvel or DC productions, and all of this on a fraction of their budget. Safe to say, DQ has hit the mother lode with Lokah. </p>
